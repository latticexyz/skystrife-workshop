# Getting started

## Prerequisites

1. git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. foundry (forge, anvil, cast) ([download](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), make sure to `foundryup` at least once)
3. node.js (v17+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
4. pnpm (`npm install pnpm --global` after installing node)

## Setup

In this tutorial we've included some initial code to get you up and running quicker. This includes React components and base TailwindCSS styles.

To get started you can fork or clone from the [Sky Strife workshop repo](https://github.com/latticexyz/skystrife-workshop) or use the command below.

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/latticexyz/skystrife-workshop.git
```

Afterwards, run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the MUD client:

```bash copy
cd skystrife-workshop && pnpm install
```

```bash copy
pnpm run dev
```

If all went well you should see this in your command line.

```bash
  VITE v4.4.9  ready in 695 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

After deployment is successful, pop over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and checkout your live app. At this point you can open up your code editor and get started!
